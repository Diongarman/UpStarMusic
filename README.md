# UpStarMusic

This project was completed as part of the following MongoDB course by Stephen Grider on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/learn/v4/overview

UpStarMusic is a CRUD based app that provides a desktop UI that enables the user to filter and sort a database of fake musicians in various ways. As part of the course I was challenged to write mongo queries that fascilitate this filtering and sorting. My work is mostly limited to that in the 'database' folder of the project.
